D2C Panasonic Chatbot
Overview
This repository hosts a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Chainlit, designed to assist users in finding Panasonic products from a dataset of 168 products across 9 categories. The dataset is detailed in the Panasonic Products: Complete Guide and Search Reference.pdf. The main application (app.py) enables users to interact with product information using a local RAG pipeline, powered by a finetuned LLM. The chatbot supports queries by category, price, features, room size (for ACs), location, and more, with features like product comparison and conversational flow.
Dataset Details
The dataset includes 168 Panasonic products with attributes such as Product ID, Category, Title, Price (INR), Image URL, Key Features, Specifications (JSON), Product URL, and more. Key dataset files:

data/FullyFinalPanasonicProducts_WithHotKeywords.csv: Primary dataset with search keywords.
docs/Panasonic Products_ Complete Guide and Search Reference.pdf: Comprehensive guide for the dataset.

Language Model (LLM) Details
The chatbot uses a finetuned Gemma2 2B model
Model: gemma2:2b 

Setup and Running the Application
Prerequisites

Python: Version 3.10.12

Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot:

Features

Product Recommendations: Suggests Panasonic products based on category, price, features, room size (for ACs), and location.
Conversational Flow: Handles greetings, price queries, product comparisons, and follow-up questions (e.g., room size and location for ACs).
Advanced Filtering: Uses room size, location-based pollution analysis (via LLM), and feature extraction for precise AC recommendations.
Product Comparison: Allows users to select products (e.g., select 1 2) and compare them in a detailed table.
Vector Store: Uses Chroma for efficient retrieval of product data, with embeddings generated by nomic-embed-text.
Caching: Implements query caching to improve response time for repeated queries.
